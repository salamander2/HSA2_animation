#HOW TO WRITE AN ANIMATION GAME

This is done using the HSA GraphicsConsole so that you don't have to learn Java Swing Graphics first.

----

*Important:*
I'm making "commits" in Git/GitHub for each major improvement. 
Please start at the first one, and go through them so that you understand what is happening.

##6. Complete!

The program is complete! Go back to step 5 to see the completed project. (As you can see there is no code in this commit; I want you to start from the beginning, Step 1.)

To look at each step, either (i) look at the commits (https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2_animation/commits/master)
or (ii) look at the TAGS (https://github.com/salamander2/HSA2_animation/tags)

You can also easily compare the code in GitHub to see what has changed from one step/tag to the next.
### Things for you to do:

There are lots of possibilities for you to expand on this.

The simplest thing is to make more blocks, have them colour coded so that the different blocks do different things.  Or you could make a totally different game. Pong is remarkably simple, so try something a bit more complex.
